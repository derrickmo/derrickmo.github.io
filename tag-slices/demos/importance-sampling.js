Lets you hit rare events (tail probabilities) that naive Monte Carlo misses, and underlies off-policy RL evaluation and particle-filter resampling. Quality lives and dies by the proposal — if q has lighter tails than p the weights have infinite variance, so monitor the Effective Sample Size ESS=(Σw)²/Σw². Self-normalized IS needs the target only up to a constant. Degrades in high dimensions; fixes are adaptive/annealed IS and SMC.",
