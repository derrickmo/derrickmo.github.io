    "summary": "The KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, so long-context serving must evict past tokens to bound memory — and which tokens you drop decides whether quality survives. Sliding-window discards the early 'attention sink' tokens that carry disproportionate mass (StreamingLLM) and perplexity spikes; keeping a few sinks + a recent window recovers it; H2O additionally retains the heavy-hitter tokens by accumulated attention. It is the OS eviction-policy problem (LRU/LFU) transplanted into attention.",
