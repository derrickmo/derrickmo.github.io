    "summary": "Synthesize new training examples by applying random transforms that change the input but not the label — horizontal flip, rotation, random-resized-crop, color/brightness jitter, and cutout/random-erasing for images. This enlarges and diversifies a finite dataset for free and bakes in known invariances, so the model learns features that survive the nuisances rather than memorizing exact pixels — one of the most reliable regularizers in deep learning. Each transform encodes a domain assumption (flipping a digit can change its label), so the augmentation set is task-specific. The idea generalizes to token masking/synonym swaps in NLP and time/frequency masking on audio, and the two-view scheme is the engine of contrastive self-supervised learning.",
