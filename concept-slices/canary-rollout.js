    "summary": "Deploy a new model (or code) safely by exposing it to a small slice of live traffic first and widening only if a health metric stays good: 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100%, with an automated guard at each stage. The guard is a statistical test (here a one-sided two-proportion z-test of the canary's error vs the stable baseline) — significantly worse triggers an automatic rollback, capping the blast radius to the few users the canary touched versus a full deploy. Guard sensitivity is a detection tradeoff: too tight rolls back good releases on noise (false alarms), too loose lets a worse model through; and at low canary traffic, small regressions are hard to distinguish from noise (low statistical power). Generalizes to blue/green, feature flags, shadow traffic, and A/B + bandit rollouts.",

    "summary": "Deploying a trained model as a service is a queueing problem before it is a math problem. A GPU runs a batch in time base + slope*size, so batching many requests amortizes the fixed overhead and raises throughput — but each request then waits for the batch to form (a max batch-window) and to finish, inflating mean and especially tail (p99) latency: the central throughput-vs-latency tradeoff. Capacity = batch / batch-time requests per second; when the arrival rate pushes utilization toward 100% the queue and latency blow up (Little's law: average queue length = arrival rate * wait time), which is why autoscaling, admission control, and load shedding exist. Continuous/in-flight batching (vLLM) refines this by swapping finished sequences out of the running batch instead of waiting.",
