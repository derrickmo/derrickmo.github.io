Fast, low-data, high-dimensional-friendly — the classic spam filter and a perennial baseline. Relaxing the diagonal constraint gives QDA (full per-class covariance) or LDA (shared); the independence assumption is usually wrong yet the argmax is often still right, though predicted probabilities end up overconfident/poorly calibrated.",
